Why were `rounder()` and `measureRain()` able to use switch cases, while
functions like `happyBirthdayPet()`, `funTypes` were not? Do you prefer `measureRain()` and `rounder()` as `if/else` or `switch` statements?

# Answer

Honestly I do not see how `happyBirthdayPet()` and `funTypes` are not able to use switch cases. I think these two functions would be able to use switch cases in the same way `measureRain()` can, which is by using `case (true)`. While `switch` statements look cleaner than `if/else` statements, the latter are more common and easier to understand, therefore I prefer the latter in case I had to explain someone how the code works.
